# C Statements

Programming instructions are called `Statements`.

Example of C Statement :

    printf("Hello World");

This is one statement. Every statement is terminated by Statement Terminator `;` (semi-colon). If you forget the semicolon (;), an error will occur and the program will not run.

  Output =>

    Hello World

Many C programs contain more than 1 statements.

For example :

    printf("Good morning.\n");
    printf("How are you?\n");
    printf("Tell me your name.\n);

  Output =>

    Good morning.
    How are you?
    Tell me your name.

It's important to note that the statements are executed one-by-one in the order they are written.
