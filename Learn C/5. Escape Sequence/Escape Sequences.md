# Escape Sequences

printf() function doesn't insert new line at the end. Therefore, we must use escape sequence.

## Escape Character 

Escape Character `\` is used to indicate that the character following it has a special meaning. This allows you to include special characters in strings that might otherwise be difficult to represent directly.

## Examples of Escape Sequences

- `\n` - Newline
- `\t` - Tab
- `\r` - Carriage return
- `\\` - Backslash\
- `\'` - Single quote
- `\"` - Double quote
- `\b` - Backspace
- `\f` - Form feed
- `\v` - Vertical tab
