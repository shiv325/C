# Change Variable Values

- `Assigning value to Variable` :

  If we have intialised a variable as

      int a = 5;

  We can change it later by assigning it another value
  
      a = 10;
  
  Now, the value is changed

- `Assigning Variable to Another Variable` :

    Initialise 2 variables with different values

      int a = 5;
      int b = 10;

    Assign value of a variable to the another variable

      b = a;
